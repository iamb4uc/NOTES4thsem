## Unit 1

### Frame Buffer
Each screen pixel corresponds to a perticular entry in a 2d array residing memory. This memory is called a frame buffer or a bit map. The number of rows in the frame buffer equals to the number of raster lines on the display screen.  

The number of columns in this array euals to the number of pixels on each raster line. The term pixel is also used to describe the row and column location in frame buffer array that corresponds to screen location. A pixel memory locations.  

Whenever we wish to display a pixel on the screen, a specific value is placed into the corresponding memory location in the frame buffer array.  

Each screen pixel location and corresponding memory location in the frame buffer is accused bu the non-negative integer co-ordinate(x,y).  

The x-value refers to the columns, y-valuev
### Aspect ratio

### Pixel
A pixel is the smallest piece of information of an image.
- Pixels are normally arranged in a regular 2D grid, and are often represented using dots or squares.
- Each pixel is a sample of an original image where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original 
- The intensity of each pixel is variable in color system, each pixel usually has 3 or 4 components "RED, GREEN and BLUE" or "CYAN, MAGENTA and YELLOW"
