# Extra Importants
### What is computer graphics?
- Art of drawing pictures onto a computer screen with the help of programming.  
- Involves  
  - creation,  
  - computation and  
  - manipulation of data  
***In Other Words:*** Computer Graphics is a rendering tool for generating and manipulating image data.  

### Application Computer Graphics
1. **Computer Art**: Using animation packages, paint packages we can create fine art as well as commercial art.  
2. **Computer Aided Drawing**: Designing of buildings, automobile, aircrafts is done with the help of CAD. This helps us in providing more accurate, detailed, and sharp drawing with better specification.
3. **Presentation Graphics**: These are software packages that are used for preparation of reports, graphs for financial and statistical information, mathematical and scientific information, economic data for research reports, managerial reports. It is also used for creation of bar, pie, time and most other form of charts.  
4. **Entertainment**: Computer Graphics is majorly used in the Entertainment industry. It is used to create motion pictures, games, music video, television shows etc.
5. **Education**: Computer generated models and diagrams are extreamly helpful for teaching huge number of concepts and fundamentals in an 'easy to understand manner'.  
6. **Training**: Using Computer graphics we can create high level simulations and virtual training programs for new candidates and students in fields such as flight simulations, simulations of various kinds of low risk surgeries etc. 
7. **Visualization**: Just like simulations there can be various kinds of visualization software used but professionals to teach and study various kinds of image data, advance technological data, etc.
8. **Image Processing**: Various kinds of images need to be processed in order to be used in certain situations, this is mostly used in photographs taken through a camera with RAW formating that cannot be seen on lower end hardware and is converted in to suitatble formats such as jpg, png, svg etc. 
9. **Machine Drawing**: Computer Graphics can be used for designing, modifying and creating various parts of a machine or the whole machine itself. 


### Refreshed CRTs or Continual CRTs
A beam of electron ie Cathode Ray, emitted by the elctron gun passes through focusing and different system that direct the beam towards specified position on the phosphor-coated screen. The phosphor than emits a small spot of light at each position in contact with the electron beam. Because the light emited by phosphor fades away very rapidly, some method is needed in maintaining the screen picture, one way to keep the phosphor glowing is to redraw the picture repeatedly by quickly directing the electron beam back over the same points. This type of display is called Refreshed CRT. 

### Components of CRT
The primary component of an electron gun in a CRT are heated electrode and control grid. Heat is supplied to the cathode by directing current through a wire or filament, inside the cylindrical cathode structure. This causes the electrons to be '**boiled-off**' the cathode surface in the vacuume tube inside. Thus CRT envelops the free, negatively charged electrons are then accelerated towards the phosphor coating by the high positive voltage.
