TSP Problem: Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.  
For example, consider the graph shown in the figure on the right side. A TSP tour in the graph is 1-2-4-3-1. The cost of the tour is 10+25+35+15 which is 80.  

Let us take another example: Consider the following directed graph to solve TSP problem:
